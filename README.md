# Key Data Structure & Algorithm

A Java-based educational project focused on implementing essential data structures and algorithms from scratch.  
Ideal for students, developers, and interview preparation.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This repository contains clean, modular implementations of core data structures and algorithms in Java.  
Each component is organized into packages for clarity and scalability.

---

## ✅ Currently Implemented

- Stack (using linked list)
