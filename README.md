# Key Data Structure & Algorithm

A Java-based educational project focused on implementing essential data structures and algorithms from scratch. Ideal for students, developers, and interview preparation.

## 📦 Project Overview

This repository contains clean, modular implementations of core data structures and algorithms in Java. Each component is organized into packages for clarity and scalability.

### ✅ Currently Implemented

- **Stack** (using linked list)

### 🛠 Upcoming Implementations

- Queue (Linked List & Array-based)
- Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
- Trees (Binary, BST, etc.)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, BFS, DFS)
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)

│   └── StackRunner.java   # Sample usage and testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Terminal or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Compile and Run

javac stack/*.java
java stack.StackRunner

🧪 Sample Code

Stack stack = new Stack(2);
stack.push(4);
stack.pop();
stack.printStack();


🎯 Goals
Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms
Practice Java OOP and clean coding principles
Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments
